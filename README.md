This is a project from my Algorithms class at the University of Miami.

It uses hash table and min-heap to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two places.


All of the information is about locations in the United States is given in data files within the "data" directory. These were provided by the professor. All of the "*.dat" files are binary files containing elevation points for many regions in the US. 

##Screenshots

Using these files, a map is drawn with a graphics library (also provided by the professor) and the actual shortest path is shown.

Lastly, directions are written to the console on how to get from the starting point to the destination point.
